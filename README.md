# Welcome to Holiday Planner!


This is a Python project where you can plan your holiday in style.
Simply choose a city and country, and the program will:

- Find its location on the map.
- Show you nearby places such as bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and supermarkets.
- Generate interactive maps where you can click markers to explore spots.
- Scrape hotel listings (name, price, rating) so you know where to stay.
- With everything combined, you’ll get your very own holiday package view — maps, hotels, and weather forecast.
